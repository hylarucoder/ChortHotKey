# Introdustion--ChortHotkey
## What is ChortHotkey?

A tool that enhence oprations on windows,which contain three parts
1. **Kommand**:cross- application vi style opretions on windows
2. **Candy**:another menu processing text,files,and so on
3. **CHKHotkeys**:a smart rewritten by me

the other two scripts(1,2) is powerfull so I have to code "My most frequently opretions" into **CHKHotkeys** autohotkey scripts,and let the ops that I cannot remmember very well configured into **candy**, modify the Kommand to operate win7 like vim.


## Design principle

**Balance Efficience and Simplity**
**Efficience** -- The most common things shoud be turned into hotkeys
**Simplity** -- The thing used not so frequent should be processed simply,quickly and naturally

## Usage

## ChangeLog
Add some autohotkey from others 

1. candy --  a powerful menu that can process long text or short,specific files with specific application,and so on.
2. kommand -- windows all in vi-style
3. MyAHK -- a script  written or searched online and modified  by me.
