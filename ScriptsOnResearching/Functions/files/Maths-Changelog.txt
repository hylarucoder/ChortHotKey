2 / 11 / 13
v3.35
* Made SM_Solve() support ** as power-identifier
* Fixed a bug with SM_ToExp() in SM_Solve()

1 / 11 / 13
v3.3
* Added SM_Number2Base() and SM_Base2Number() for number base conversions

1 / 11 / 13
v3.25
* Solve() - Added support for functions with e, c or p (See Documentation)
* Solve() - Added native support for functions with ! or ^

30 / 10 / 13
v3.0
* Added SM_FromExp(exponential_number)
* Made SM_Solve() enhancements - 
	- Supports Nesting via   (    brackets now (instead of [])
 	- accept factorial (45! * 23!)
	- accept power sign (4^3)
	- accept scientific notation ( 2.323e10 * 2312.e-12 )
	- accept expressions in functions ( sin(4!+2+3!) )
* Renamed SM_Exp() to SM_ToExp() though SM_Exp() is still valid.
